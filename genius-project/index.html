        <p class="subheader ">For years, cats were deemed an "underdog " of the pet community -- pun intended. The canine half of the classic household duo was routinely considered smarter, friendlier, and more socially capable. Recently, however, that's begun to change. More
            and more people are asking themselves just how smart cats truly are. </p>

        <p class="subheader ">The answer? </p>

        <p class="subheader ">A whole lot more than anyone used to think.</p>

        <h2>Comparing Canine and Feline Intelligence</h2>

        <p>There are many different ways of comparing feline and canine intelligence. At face level, none of them work.</p>

        <p>You can say that cats have a smaller brain for their size than dogs do. However, their surface folding and structure -- also crucial -- is 90% similar to humans. Cat also have twice as many neurons as dogs, and more nerve cells in visual brain
            areas than most mammals, including humans.</p>

        <p>Scientists have found that cats can follow puzzles, but unlike dogs who seek help from humans, cats are more independent. They don't seek help; they simply power through. </p>

        <p>Another difference is that cats were domesticated from solitary hunters -- they only developed their vocal cues to communicate with humans -- and used, again, as solitary animals with no expectations of greater socialization. Meanwhile, dogs evolved
            from pack animals, and were continuously put in positions of adventure and socialization. Thus, dogs have historically been raised more socially and exposed to many different environments, whereas cats have been denied this opportunity. So,
            traditional tests bringing animals to equal labs is a natural disadvantage to felines.</p>

        <p>Lastly, modern research can't be expected to adequately compare cats and dogs, because canine research is about 15 years ahead of feline research. Scientists haven't spent as much time focusing on cats; thus, we know far less about the extent
            of their capabilites than we do dogs. However, current research suggests that canines and felines do indeed have rather similar intelligence levels.</p>
